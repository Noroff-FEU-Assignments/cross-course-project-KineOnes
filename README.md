## Description

## Getting Started

# Changes

-I changes the header in my final website design. In the original figma file I had a black horizontal line right under the header. To make it more readable and for people with sight disbilities I changed it to have an white, transparent background instead.

-On the nav line on mobile screen there was a cart icon on my Figma file. I decided to keep the text for cart instead to make the style and design be more balanced with three text elements centered
instead.

-In my Figma file all the product pages had the header with white text and logo. This was to make a bigger contrast. Decided to keep the header elements blach on all pages since I had the white, transparent background for contrast instead.
