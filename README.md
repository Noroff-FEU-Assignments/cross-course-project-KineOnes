# RainyDays website

From the choosen breif in Design1, and the prototype made in Figma, make a working website for the outdoor clothing webshop RainyDays.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. Certain functionality requiring JavaScript can be mimicked; for example, a login page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button.

-The HTML should be semantic and neat.
-The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
-The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. -Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap; we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
-The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
-Each page should have a unique < meta name="description">, < title>, and < h1>.
-You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by yourself. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, which should be included in your report.

# Changes

-I changes the header in my final website design. In the original figma file I had a black horizontal line right under the header. To make it more readable and for people with sight disbilities I changed it to have an white, transparent background instead.

-On the nav line on mobile screen there was a cart icon on my Figma file. I decided to keep the text for cart instead to make the style and design be more balanced with three text elements centered
instead.

-In my Figma file all the product pages had the header with white text and logo. This was to make a bigger contrast. Decided to keep the header elements blach on all pages since I had the white, transparent background for contrast instead.

### research and process

I thought this course was really fun, challenging and a bit overwhelming. I used a lot of time doing the module lessons and activities, trying to understand how to code and the whole semantic / syntax. Some stages I really got stuck and felt like one step forward was two steps back. In the end I had alot of help from teachers feedback. I ended up coding all the pages from scratch again to follow the DRY principle and understand each step and code. I am happy with my final product, considering this all felt greek from the start.
